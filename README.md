# 07-2D Platformer

This was a project for my Game Technolgy Course at IU where the goal was to make a 2D Platformer. It was honestly moslty a failure. The teacher said we were allowed to use the game from the debugging assignment as a guide for this one but I think I just took to much. I tried adding my own features like a double jump and bottomless pits but I thought in needed to start with the game in my repostiroty as base and copied a lot of it over. I changed most of the assest to make it feel different but I think I just made it worst. Most importantly, I failed to implement a save system because at first I forgot it was a requirment and when I did it was too late to ask for help. So I eneded up turning it in two days late because even if I did figure out how to get it to work I would have lost too many points from it being late for it to be worth it, though in the end, I wouldn't be surprised if I got a zero. I have no one to blame but myself. I clearly needed to put in more time in working on it earlier on I didn't.
