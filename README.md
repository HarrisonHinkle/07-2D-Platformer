# 07-2D Platformer

This was a project for my Game Technolgy Course at IU where the goal was to make a 2D Platformer. It was honestly moslty a failure. The teacher said we were allowed to use the game from the debugging assignment as a guide for this one but I think I just took to much. I tried adding my own features like a double jump and bottomless pits but I thought in needed to start with the game in my repostiroty as base and copied a lot of it over. I changed most of the assest to make it feel different but I think I just made it worst. Most importantly, Most importantly, I didn't get a far as I needed to with the save system implementation. I could only get it to save and load the score and death count, not what level you were on (though I made it restart what level you were on when you loaded the save) and doing it doing on the stat screen sends you to level one.
