# 07-2D Platformer

This was a project for my Game Technolgy Course at IU where the goal was to make a 2D Platformer. It was honestly moslty a failure. The teacher said we were allowed to use the game from the debugging assignment as a guide for this one but I think I just took to much. I tried adding my own features like a double jump and bottomless pits but I thought in needed to start with the game in my repostiroty as base and copied a lot of it over. I changed most of the assest to make it feel different but I think I just made it worst. Most importantly, Most importantly, I didn't get a far as I needed to with the save system implementation. I could only get it to save and load the score and death count, no what level you were on and you can only do it from the pause menu in a level (open it by hitting "enter"). I tried adding it to the start screen but when I did it caused the player to lose all colision with the enemies and gems and I'm not sure why.
